# Face-Detection
This project detects the face using the haarcascade algorithim and openCV.
Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection. This method was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features .Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier. 
    Positive images – These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify.
    Negative Images – Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect.
